# TextUtils

TextUtils is a simple React-based web application that allows users to manipulate and analyze text. The application provides features such as counting words and characters, removing extra spaces, and toggling between light and dark modes.

This is my first project built using React, aimed at enhancing my understanding of React.js and its ecosystem.

## Features

- **Word Count:** Displays the total number of words in the input text.
- **Character Count:** Displays the total number of characters in the input text.
- **Text Manipulation:** Allows users to remove extra spaces from their text.
- **Dark Mode:** Toggle between light and dark themes for better readability.
- **Responsive Design:** Works well on all devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
